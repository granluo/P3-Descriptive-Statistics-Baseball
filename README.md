# Descriptive-Statistics-Baseball


We all know that a baseball club has to spend tons of money to hire players for wins. We will find out reasons behind the wins in this project.

For this project, we will conduct data analysis and create a file to share our findings.
We start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming the following questions we could answer using it. 

1. What does a team with highest win rate look like? Is it realted to how much the team paid for players or the number of bases it had?

2. Can a team with low salary payments win a lot?

Then we use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions we are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.
